#+TITLE: A modular tetris game library

Modulartetris is a C library of a flexible and modular tetris game.
All the logic (board, blocks, collision, game over) is contained inside this library,
so you only have to worry about the input control and drawing logic of your platform.

Because of [[http://www.swig.org/][swig]] support, you can also bind this library to many programming languages.

To run in the browser, the library is compiled from C to [[http://asmjs.org/faq.html][asm.js]] format using [[https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/][emscripten]].
The visual game was +stolen+ based on [[https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris][javascript-tetris]]. Check the final [[https://gjhenrique.github.io/modulartetris/][result.]]

* Custom Blocks Format
Bored of the same and old tetrominoes?
This library gives a way to customize the blocks provided by an external file.

For example, including this file:
#+BEGIN_SRC
# All the blocks should be a square matrix
3
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1

3
1 0 1
0 0 0
0 1 0
#+END_SRC

You will have this game:

* How to use it

After connecting the library with your programming language, you can call the following functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
// You can pass a file or a string with your custom blocks
struct Board *board = create_board_file(char *file_name, int width, int height);
struct Board *board = create_board_string(char *blocks_string, int width, int height);

// Move down the current block a single unit
next_move(board);

 //Moves the current block to the right or the left
move_left(board);
move_right(board);

 // Push the current block to the bottom
move_to_bottom(board);

 //Current block rotation
rotate_clockwise(board);
rotate_anticlockwise(board);

// Pseudocode to draw on the screen
for (height in board.height)
    for(width in board.width)
        color = board.board_values[i][j]
        draw_board(height, width, color)
#+END_SRC

* Tests
#+BEGIN_SRC
make run_tests
./run_tests
#+END_SRC

* Ncurses

Game graphics and input from[[https://github.com/theabraham/terminal-tetris][ terminal-tetris]]. Only changed the game logic.
#+BEGIN_SRC
make ncurses_games
# default_blocks is the file containing the default tetrominoes, 13 is the width and 20 is the height
./ncurses_game default_blocks 13 20
#+END_SRC
* Android

[[file:img/android.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
make android_swig
Download NDK r10e to use the Gradle Experimental Plugin
Import android folder and include the NDK into Android Studio
Run app
#+END_SRC

* Python

[[file:img/python.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
# Had problems installing pygame with pip from pyenv. Had to use system python
sudo pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
make python_swig
/usr/bin/python3 python/tetris_game.py
#+END_SRC

* Node
#+BEGIN_SRC
# Only javascript binding included
make node_swig
pushd node; node-gyp rebuild; popd;
node node/tetris_game.js
#+END_SRC
* Javascript (asm.js)
First of all, you have to install [[https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html][emscripten]]
#+BEGIN_SRC
# Put emcc in your path
source <emsdk>/emsdk_env.sh
make javascript_asmjs
# Open the game in your preferred browser
xdg-open javascript/index.html
#+END_SRC
